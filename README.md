# Using Deep Learning to detect different types of Cancers and variants.

This project was completed as part of my Senior project at Luther College
The project was split into 6 phases each with distinct additions:
- Phase 1: Initial model testing using tensoflow custom CNN
- Phase 2: Adding Data Augmentation
- Phase 3: Optimising using HyperBand
- Phase 4: Switch to ResNet50
- Phase 5: Split Data to be group by scan type, 4 models using tensoflow custom CNN
- Phase 6: Same as phase 5 but with ResNet50
